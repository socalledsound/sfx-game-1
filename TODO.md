- new solved sound(s) -- xylophone?  something I make in logic?

- new click sounds -- make an array of them, so that there's a different one for each level that get's crossed

- make each game levels be thematic?  eg a game level that is all different bells


- text/name output: if length of a word is less than 4 characters, don't start a new line?

- SVG for text output?  ie over the top of the canvas?  so I can keep the darkened out boxes and maybe even have a playback bar?
